# Seagull Scaring V2
A seagull scaring program with GUI written in Python.
By Gabriel Alonso-Holt.

The days of having me run around scaring seagulls manually are over! With Seagull Scaring, you can just start the program, choose a time to scare seagulls for, and relax as the seagulls fly away when you want.

**Before you proceed, sound effects are not included!**

Recommended settings: 2700 seconds (timer), 60 seconds (min time), 300 seconds (max time), seagull (sound).
